### CI328 Lecture 7 - Gameplay

- Game design / theory

---

#### Last Week Recap

- Good Programming Practices

---

#### All About Numbers

- Players like progress in any form but especially numerical
- Hero level, hit points, currency, number of items, etc.
- Mechanic: dice roll, combat maths, economics

---

#### All About Numbers

- Think about your game and come up with one example

---

#### All About Numbers

Example: side quests.

Players will still take those even if not relevant to the story.
Primary reason: good (rare) rewards.

---

#### All About Numbers

Obtaining rare items by chance.
Example: refine an item with 1 metal to gain +10 damage.
Success chance: 60%.
If the item is not refined, it will be broken.

---

#### Gameplay type

What do you want the player to do?

- Intellect-driven (strategise and analyse)
- Skill-driven (refine common repetitive actions)
- Casual (time killer)

---

#### Engagement

Define clear win and lose conditions.
Players will engage quicker.
However, pay attention to difficulty: too easy / too difficult.

---

#### Balance

Allow new players to have a chance of defeating old (experienced) players.
Examples: reduced stats for experienced players,
leaderboard reset,
PvE adjustment based on player level.
Alternative solutions: matchmaking.

---

#### Player Experience

- Sound effects / music - easy way to add immersion
- Story: game world state is bad, player appears, player actions
make the state better, villain reveals his secret power, state is bad again,
player learns new power, player wins, state is now good

---

#### Activity / Interactive

Find a game that you like,
consider why you like it.
Can you implement a particular gameplay feature
in your game?

---

#### Conclusion

Gameplay is at the same time the easiest and the hardest aspect
of the game being developed.
Standard practices exist.
