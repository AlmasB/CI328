- Mapping Game Architecture to Phaser

---

#### Last Week Recap

- Game Architecture

---

#### How to Manage Time (Case Study)

- Design and build Mario clone

---

#### How to Manage Time (Tasks)

- Decompose one big problem into many smaller ones
- Identify tasks need to complete each problem
- Assign priorities (core or optional) and order

---

#### How to Manage Time (Deadlines)

- Know your deadlines (including other modules)
- Calculate **softer** deadlines from **hard** deadlines

---

#### How to Manage Time (Timeline)

- Implement the simplest thing that works, then refine
- Always have a working system

---

#### How to Manage Time (Scoped vs Real-world)

- Fixed tasks vs variable tasks
- Tasks carefully chosen vs unknown territory
- Academic support vs field experts

---

#### Game Architecture (Start)

- Entry point - browser open page
