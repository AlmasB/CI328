### CI328 Lecture 3 - Project Management, Phaser Architecture

- Time Management
- Mapping Game Architecture to Phaser

---

#### Last Week Recap

- Game Architecture

---

#### How to Manage Time (Case Study)

- Design and build Mario clone

---

#### How to Manage Time (Tasks)

- Decompose one big problem into many smaller ones
- Identify tasks need to complete each problem
- Assign priorities (core or optional) and order

---

#### How to Manage Time (Deadlines)

- Know your deadlines (including other modules)
- Calculate **softer** deadlines from **hard** deadlines

---

#### How to Manage Time (Timeline)

- Estimate how long each core task takes
- Use Gantt chart (or alternative) to map core tasks to timeline
- Consider optional tasks if possible

---

#### How to Manage Time (Quality vs Time)

- Settle for "good enough" and move on
- Swap a complex task for a simple one
- Implement the simplest thing that works, then refine
- Always have a working system
- Avoid burnout

---

#### How to Manage Time (Scoped vs Real-world)

- Fixed tasks vs variable tasks
- Tasks carefully chosen vs unknown territory
- Academic support vs field experts

---

#### Assignment Game Idea

- Can implement 100% now? - Too easy
- Don't know how to implement at all? - Too complex
- Roughly 50-50 know-don't know? - Probably a good idea

---

#### Game Architecture (Start - Exit)

- Entry point - browser open page
- Init / Loop
- Exit - Browser tab close

---

#### Case Study (Simple Phaser Game)

To provide a point of reference ...

- Examine [Phaser Invaders](https://github.com/AlmasB/CI328Demo)
- Examine [FXGL Invaders](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames/tree/master/SpaceInvaders)

#### Conclusion

- Managing time - always have a plan
- Phaser architecture - simplifies software design

#### Next Week

- Game Maths

#### Tutorial

- Identify tasks specific to your game
- Use GitHub repo Milestones and Issues to capture tasks
- Explore Phaser, play around with example games
- Start populating your GitHub repo with basic examples
