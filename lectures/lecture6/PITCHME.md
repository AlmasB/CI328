### CI328 Lecture 6 - Good Programming Practices

How to write ...

- ~~good~~ _not bad_ code
- robust code
- maintainable code

---

#### Software Design

- Capture goals and data
- Flexible - requirements change
- YAGNI, KISS, DRY

---

#### Classes

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Encapsulate data

---

#### Functions

> "FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY."

---

#### Comments / Documentation

- Only if it adds value
- Explain intent (why and NOT what)
- Keep up to date, or don't keep at all

---

#### Using 3rd Party Code

- Isolate via own bridge / adapter

---

#### Exceptions

- Input validation
- Don't muddle exceptions and logic

---

#### Workspace and Code

- Clear project directory structure
- Source code management
- Consistent indentation
- Naming conventions

---

#### Testing

- Do it!
- Should be small (one feature), fast and serve as a specification
- Successive refinement (incremental, the system always works / passes tests)
- Easier refactoring

---

#### Continuous Integration

- Automates the process
- Travis-CI

---

#### Conclusion

- Can't replace experience (expect to put in hours), but ...
- Can avoid writing bad code by following guides
