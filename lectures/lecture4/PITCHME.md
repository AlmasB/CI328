### CI328 Lecture 4 - Game Maths

- Point and Vector
- Transformations (Translate, Scale, Rotate)

---

#### Game Dev Maths

- Fundamental to the field
- Ranges from basic to very complex
- Important to know the difference between what, why and how

---

#### Point

- Location / position in space
- Extendible to n dimensions
- Crucial to most games

---

#### Game World vs Screen

- Positive Y axis
- Not always 1 to 1 mapping
- Visible area (viewport into _infinite_ world)

---

#### Point (Use Case)

- Distance to things
- Relative position to things

---

#### Vector

- Displacement with direction and length (magnitude)
- Describes velocity, acceleration, direction, etc.
- Extendible to n dimensions

---

#### Vector (Use Case)

- Distance to things (recall point)
- Direction of an object
- Force / speed via length
- Angle representation

---

#### Transformations (Translate)

- Means move
- Apply over time to create a moving animation
- Apply with acceleration to simulate movement

---

#### Transformations (Scale)

- Means growing or shrinking
- Apply over time to create an animation
- Changes object dimensions (note for collisions)

---

#### Transformations (Rotate)

- Means changing angle
- Apply over time to create a spinning animation
- Changes occupying space (note for collisions)

---

#### Applying Concepts

- Demo of a moving object
- Demo with acceleration
- Demo with gravity

---

#### Conclusion

- Maths - very important for games
- Not complex in 2D
