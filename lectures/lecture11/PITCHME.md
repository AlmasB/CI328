#### References

If not your work, **reference** it:

---

#### Code

- Remember and, importantly, **use** good practices
- Only valuable comments
- Short and simple classes / functions

- Structure your code **and** your assets

---

#### Report

- Clear structure
- Strong technical discussion
- Evidence of analysis
- Critique / reflection
- Concise -- long reports are a sign of poor preparation
