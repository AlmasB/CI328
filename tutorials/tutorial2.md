## Tutorial 2 - Set up GitHub repo

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Create a new repository called CI328Demo (check box - initialize with README.md)
3. Follow the sequence of steps on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to set up GitHub pages
4. Go to the created CI328Demo repository and click Settings
5. Scroll down to GitHub Pages and in the "Source", select `master branch`, then Save
6. Remember the given link, it can be used to access your static site.
7. Open [Examples Repo](https://github.com/AlmasB/CI328) and click `download`, then `zip`.
8. Unzip and go to the `examples` directory.
9. Finally, upload files / directories from `examples` to your CI328Demo repository.

After a few seconds, if you access the link from step 6, you will see an example Phaser app.
You can use most of these steps to set up static pages for other repositories.

You can also use GitHub fork to simplify some processes above but it is more beneficial for you to know
how to do the setup from scratch.
